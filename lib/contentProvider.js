    Developing a business plan is a function of thinking, researching, evaluating and planning. This Business Plan tool can help you through this process.

    If you are in the early stages of business development, use the tool as a way to guide your thinking. You won’t have all the answers right away, but you can use the tool to take notes and to get a feel for how you might focus your research.

    If you’re in a later stage of business development, you can use the tool as a jumping off point for crafting a written plan that you can deliver to investors and other stakeholders.

        When you are in the design and planning stages of your business, don’t get hung up on refining every sentence of your plan. The writing will be easier once the planning process is complete.

        The executive summary is generally considered the most important part of a business plan. A summary of the key points you want your audience to tune into, it describes your business, its market and customers, your company goals, and how you will meet them.

        Depending on which audience you are presenting your plan to, you can tailor this section to showcase what you want them to know.

        In this part of the business plan, you’ll ensure that your business will have the management expertise needed to be a success. When starting a business, entrepreneurs wear many hats. At one moment you may be responsible for marketing and sales. The next moment you may need to order supplies, answer phones, or clean the showroom.
        <br><br>
        This rarely lasts for those companies that grow. The demands of a successful business force entrepreneurs to add employees or a management team to the operations of the business.
        <br><br>
        As you answer questions for the management and organization plan, highlight both the current and future management needs of the business. Current needs identify the responsibilities carried out by you and others as you start the business. Future needs identify the responsibilities that will require additional management team members.
        <br><br>
        If any members of your management team lack the necessary credentials or experience, explain how these deficiencies will be overcome with assistance from the board of directors, an advisory council, consultants, attorneys, accountants, and other resources.

            It’s best to show each management position, even if you are the one performing all these functions. This practice will give you a healthy perspective about the different roles that you will be required to fill and provide you with an understanding of the key team members that you must recruit in the future.

    Now a global standard, the Business Model Canvas template was developed by a team of researchers from Switzerland at <a href="https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas">Strategyzer</a> and has been refined with input from over 400 professionals who study or create startups. Like an artist’s color wheel, the Business Model Canvas does not prevent the entrepreneur from coming up with unique combinations that are relevant to his or her own circumstances.

    Use the Business Model Canvas tool to help you sketch out your business model. You may even find it useful to sketch out multiple models and compare them.

    description: `Throughout the life of your business you’re going to be pitching it. This can come in many forms. You may be just in a business idea phase and pitching your thoughts to a friend over coffee, or you may be well established and growing and pitching your business to investors and internal stakeholders.

    The way that you describe your business—everything from the problem it solves to it future milestones—will change over time as your business grows. It will also change depending on who you are talking to—if you’re talking to an investor you’ll pitch who you are and what you do in one way. If you’re talking to a client, you’ll tailor your talking points to meet their needs.

    The important thing is to think through the way you want to pitch your key talking points to others. And to practice your messaging and delivery—make sure your message is really resonating with your audience.

    This Pitch tool is a space where you can reflect and collect your key pitch messages. As you go throughout the course, you’ll be pointed to different activities that are part of the pitch tool. Use this tool to help you refine your thinking as you go along, and also come back to update it as your thinking changes.

    Because things will change. The problem you solve may change, the way you describe it may change. But if you are able to articulate your current thoughts that will give you the best jumping off point to refine your ideas, research your ideas, and learn about your business from talking about it to others — no matter what stage you are in. *Add point about how you describe business to others when getting feedback/market research`,
